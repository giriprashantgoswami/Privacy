Data Deletion Instructions
==========================

### User Steps to Request Data Deletion

1. Navigate to the app's settings screen and select "Delete Account" or "Request Data Deletion".
2. Confirm your request by re-authenticating if prompted.
3. The app will initiate the data deletion process.

### App Handling of Data Deletion Requests

1. The app receives the deletion request and triggers the `deleteUserData` method.
2. This method performs a batch deletion of user data across multiple Firestore collections.
3. The affected collections include `users`, `schedules`, and `social_accounts`.

### Technical Details

* The app uses Firebase Firestore for data storage.
* Data deletion is handled through the `deleteUserData` method in `FirebaseService`.
* This method ensures atomic deletion across affected collections using Firestore's batch operations.

By following these steps and understanding the technical implementation, users can effectively request and manage their data deletion within the app.
